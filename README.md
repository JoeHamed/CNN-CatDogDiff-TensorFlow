# Convolutional Neural Network for Cat vs Dog Classification
- This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs.
- It covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and making predictions.
## Features
- Preprocessing of images with ImageDataGenerator.
- CNN model for binary classification.
- Predict whether an image is a cat or a dog.
